# Make a Shit First
Don't wait everything get prepared, make a shit first

## Disclaimer

I found myself really like wasting all my time thinking and preparing and try to make something really perfect. After several weeks/months I realize that I didn't do anything except "thinking/preparing/architecting" the fucking project instead of taking a try and make a shit first.

This repo is just to remind myself and log everytime when I trying to make something really perfect. This repo does not trying to insult anybody and it is purely personal.

## Logs - most recent first

Today trying to find a perfect way to install linux kernel header in wsl2, but didn't try any fucking one of them because they all require rebuild the kernel! Waste whole afternoon like an idot.
